# Euler System

A sophisticated volatility regime detection system that analyzes hidden macrotrends to identify market regime shifts. This system is designed not to predict specific market movements, but rather to understand the underlying volatility environment and market stress conditions.

## System Overview

The Euler system combines multiple volatility indicators across different time horizons to provide a holistic view of market conditions. It processes data on three main dimensions:

1. **Live Indicators**: Real-time market stress and volatility metrics
2. **Velocity Indicators**: Rate of change analysis (1D, 1W, 1M basis)
3. **Acceleration Indicators**: Change in rate of change (1D, 1W, 1M basis)

## Market Regime Levels (0-100 Scale)

The system outputs a score from 0-100 and classifies market conditions into ten distinct regimes:

1. **Extreme Calm (0-10)** ðŸŸ©
   - Unusually low volatility across all timeframes
   - Strong risk appetite, potentially complacent conditions
   - Historical examples: Extended bull markets, peak QE periods
   - Warning: May indicate market complacency

2. **Low Stress (10-20)** ðŸŸ©
   - Below-average volatility
   - Healthy market functioning with normal trading volumes
   - Term structure in steady contango
   - Favorable conditions for systematic strategies

3. **Stable (20-30)** ðŸŸ©
   - Normal market functioning
   - Volatility near long-term averages
   - Balanced put/call activity
   - Constructive trading environment

4. **Mild Uncertainty (30-40)** ðŸŸ¨
   - Early signs of hedging activity
   - Slight elevation in near-term volatility
   - Minor term structure distortions
   - Typical pre-event positioning

5. **Elevated Caution (40-50)** ðŸŸ¨
   - Above-average volatility
   - Increased hedging costs
   - Early signs of risk reduction
   - Heightened market sensitivity

6. **High Uncertainty (50-60)** ðŸŸ§
   - Significant volatility elevation
   - Notable increase in tail risk pricing
   - Term structure flattening
   - Active defensive positioning

7. **Stress Conditions (60-70)** ðŸŸ¥
   - Material risk reduction across assets
   - Volatility term structure inversions
   - Elevated put/call ratios
   - Liquidity deterioration

8. **High Stress (70-80)** ðŸŸ¥
   - Broad risk aversion
   - Sharp volatility spikes
   - Significant defensive positioning
   - Systematic strategy deleveraging

9. **Severe Stress (80-90)** â¬›
   - Acute market stress
   - Extreme volatility levels
   - Widespread forced liquidation
   - Major systematic strategy disruption

10. **Crisis (90-100)** â¬›
    - Extreme market dislocation
    - Historic volatility levels
    - Market functioning impaired
    - Potential intervention conditions

### Live Indicators

These indicators provide real-time insights into market conditions:

- **^VIX9D**: 9-day implied volatility for near-term event risk detection
- **^VIX**: 30-day implied volatility (the classic "fear gauge")
- **^VIX3M**: 3-month implied volatility for medium-term stress assessment
- **^VIX6M**: 6-month implied volatility for structural risk evaluation
- **^SKEW**: Tail risk pricing indicator
- **^CPC**: Put/Call ratio for sentiment analysis
- **Near-term Stress Ratio**: ^VIX9D/^VIX for event window analysis
- **3M Term Slope**: ^VIX/^VIX3M for contango/backwardation analysis
- **6M Term Slope**: ^VIX/^VIX6M for long-term volatility regime assessment
- **Buffett Indicator**: Total Market Cap/GDP for macro valuation regime detection

### Velocity Indicators (1D, 1W, 1M)

Track the rate of change in key metrics to identify momentum and trend development:
- First derivative of volatility metrics
- Measures speed of regime transitions
- Helps identify acceleration/deceleration in market stress

### Acceleration Indicators (1D, 1W, 1M)

Monitor changes in the rate of change to detect regime shift catalysts:
- Second derivative of volatility metrics
- Identifies inflection points in market stress
- Crucial for early detection of regime transitions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Signal Processing

1. **Standardization**:
   - Compute z-scores (20d/60d/120d)
   - Track persistence counters for key ratios 
   - Winsorize 1% tails to handle outliers

2. **Market State Classification**:

   **Green (Calm)**:
   - ^VIX9D/^VIX < 1.0
   - ^VIX/^VIX3M < 0.95
   - ^VIX z60d < +0.5

   **Yellow (Event Risk)**:
   - ^VIX9D/^VIX â‰¥ 1.05 OR
   - ^CPC 5d > 0.85 OR
   - ^SKEW > 135

   **Red (Escalating)**:
   - ^VIX/^VIX3M â‰¥ 1.0 AND
   - ^VIX z60d â‰¥ +1.0 AND
   - persistence(^VIX/^VIX3M > 1, â‰¥3 days)

3. **Signal Smoothing**:
   - Use 5-day EMA for noise reduction
   - Apply to ^CPC and ^SKEW particularly

## Usage Notes

- System is designed for regime detection, not direct trading signals
- Combine multiple indicators for higher confidence readings
- Consider market context (OPEX, holidays, major events)
- Use z-scores to standardize across different volatility regimes
