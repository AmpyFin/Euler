# Acceleration Indicators

## Overview

Acceleration indicators track the second derivative (rate of change of the rate of change) of key volatility metrics. These indicators are crucial for early detection of regime transitions and market stress acceleration/deceleration.

## Time Horizons

Indicators are calculated on three time bases:
- 1-day (1D): Ultra-short-term acceleration
- 1-week (1W): Short-term acceleration trends
- 1-month (1M): Medium-term acceleration patterns

## Implementation Details

### Calculation Methodology

For each base indicator (VIX series, ratios, etc.):
1. Calculate first derivative (velocity)
2. Compute rate of change of velocity
3. Apply appropriate smoothing
4. Generate standardized metrics (z-scores)

### Signal Generation

- **Positive Acceleration**: Increasing rate of change
  - May indicate rapidly building stress
  - Watch for confirmation across time frames
  - Consider institutional positioning impact

- **Negative Acceleration**: Decreasing rate of change
  - May signal stress peak or reversal
  - Monitor for stabilization patterns
  - Track alongside absolute levels

### Usage Guidelines

1. **Regime Shift Detection**:
   - Watch for concurrent acceleration across timeframes
   - Monitor persistence of acceleration signals
   - Consider market context and liquidity conditions

2. **False Signal Mitigation**:
   - Use appropriate smoothing techniques
   - Consider calendar effects (OPEX, holidays)
   - Monitor alongside primary indicators

3. **Implementation Notes**:
   - Winsorize extreme values
   - Apply consistent smoothing across metrics
   - Consider institutional effects

## Key Considerations

- Higher noise in shorter timeframes
- Calendar effects can distort readings
- Institutional flows impact acceleration patterns
- Combine with primary indicators for context
- Use appropriate smoothing techniques
